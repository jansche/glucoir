# glucoir
Build a IR blaster on Raspberry Pi and have a script transform your blood glucose levels into color coding of a LED strip

## What's this for?
I wanted to have my desk illuminated in colors representing my current blood glucose level. I'm Type 1 Diabetic (T1D), and I need to keep an eye on my blood glucose (BG) levels. Doing this while coding would mean I'd need to have my phone side by side or a website open, that shows my BG. Being in the flow while working, this is not very convenient. So I tried to find a subtle yet acknowledgeable method. I've put a color controllable LED strip under my glass desk topping, and needed to find a way to auto remote control it's remote control. 

## What you will need
A LED strip, that can change RGB colors via IR remote
A Raspberry Pi (I used a 3B)
A IR receiver diode
A IR emitter diode
A breadboard
Some jumper wires
A resistor (220K Ohm)
